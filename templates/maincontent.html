        <h2>Healthy Eating:</h2>

        <p>Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.
            Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.
            They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.
            Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.
            Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content - for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p></p>

        <p>It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.
            Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?
            A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.
            A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.</p>

        <p>Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.
            Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.
            Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease.</p>

            <p>Oily fish include:</p>

            <p>- salmon</p>
            <p>- trout</p>
            <p>- herring</p>
            <p>- sardines</p>
            <p>- pilchards</p>
            <p>- mackerel</p>

            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>

            <p>You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.
                There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.
                On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.</p>

        <p>Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.
                Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much.
                About three-quarters of the salt you eat is already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces.
                Use food labels to help you cut down. More than 1.5g of salt per 100g means the food is high in salt.</p>

        <p>You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking 6 to 8 glasses every day. This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat.
            All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, lower fat milk and lower sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, are healthier choices. 
            Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're high in calories. They're also bad for your teeth. 
            Even unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are high in free sugar.
            Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day, which is a small glass.
            Remember to drink more fluids during hot weather or while exercising.</p>

        <p>Some people skip breakfast because they think it'll help them lose weight.
            But a healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health.
            A wholegrain lower sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.</p>
