        <h2>Healthy Eating Advice:</h2>


        <h3>Starch</h3>

        <p>Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.</p>
        <p>Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.</p>
        <p>They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.</p>
        <p>Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening,
        <p>but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content
        <p>- for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Fruit and Vegetables</h3>

        <p>It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.</p>
        <p>Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?</p>
        <p>A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.</p>
        <p>A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion,
        <p>but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Protein</h3>    

        <p>Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.</p>
        <p>Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.</p>
        <p>Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease.</p>

            <p>Oily fish include:</p>

            <p>- salmon</p>
            <p>- trout</p>
            <p>- herring</p>
            <p>- sardines</p>
            <p>- pilchards</p>
            <p>- mackerel</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Fat</h3>

            <p>You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.</p>
            <p>There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.</p>
            <p>On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.</p>


            <br>

        <h3>Salt</h3>

        <p>Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.</p>
        <p>Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much.</p>
        <p>About three-quarters of the salt you eat is already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces.</p>
        <p>Use food labels to help you cut down. More than 1.5g of salt per 100g means the food is high in salt.</p>


        <br>

        <h3>Water Intake</h3>

        <p>You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking 6 to 8 glasses every day.</p>
        <p>This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat.</p>
        <p>All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, lower fat milk and lower sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, are healthier choices.</p> 
        <p>Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're high in calories. They're also bad for your teeth. </p>
        <p>Even unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are high in free sugar.</p>
        <p>Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day, which is a small glass.</p>
        <p>Remember to drink more fluids during hot weather or while exercising.</p>


        <br>


        <h3>Breakfast</h3>

        <p>Some people skip breakfast because they think it'll help them lose weight.</p>
        <p>But a healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health.</p>
        <p>A wholegrain lower sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.</p>

        <h2>Fitness Training Advice:</h2>


        <h3>Aerobic Fitness</h3>

        <p>Aerobic activity, also known as cardio or endurance activity, is the core of most fitness training programs.</p>
        <p>Aerobic activity or exercise causes you to breathe faster and more deeply. The breathing boosts how much oxygen is in the blood.</p>
        <p>The heart will beat faster, which sends more blood flow to the muscles and back to the lungs.</p>
        
        <p>Aerobic activity includes any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and raises the heart rate, such as:<p>

            <p></p>
            <p></p>

            <p>- Walking</p>
            <p>- Jogging</p>
            <p>- Biking</p>
            <p>- Swimming</p>
            <p>- Dancing</p>
            <p>- Water aerobics</p>
            <p>- Leaf raking</p>
            <p>- Snow shoveling</p>
            <p>- Vacuuming</p>

            <br>

            <p>For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate</p>
            <p>aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.</p>


            <br>


            <h3>Strength Training</h3>

            <p>Strength training is another key part of a fitness training plan. Muscular fitness can help you increase bone strength</p>
            <p>and muscle fitness. And it can help you stay at a healthy weight or lose weight. It also can improve your skills in doing everyday activities.</p>
            <p>Aim to do strength training of all the major muscle groups at least twice a week.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Core Exercises</h3>

            <p>The muscles in the stomach area, also called abdomen, lower back and pelvis are known as the core muscles.</p>
            <p>Core muscles help protect the back and connect upper and lower body movements.</p>
            <p>Core strength is a key part of a well-rounded fitness training program.</p>
            <p>A core exercise is any exercise that uses the trunk of the body without support.</p>
            <p>Some core exercises are bridges, planks, situps and fitness ball exercises.</p>


            <br>


            <h3>Flexibility and Stretching</h3>

            <p>Aim to have stretching and flexibility activities in a fitness plan. Stretching exercises can help increase flexibility.</p>
            <p>Being more flexible can make it easier for you to do many everyday activities.</p>
            <p>Stretching can also improve the range of motion of the joints. And stretching may help with better posture.</p>
            <p>Regular stretching can even help lessen stress and tension.</p>
